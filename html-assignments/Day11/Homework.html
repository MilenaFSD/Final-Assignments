<h2>What to Plant</h2>
<p>Plants are chosen as much for their
functionality as for their color and
form...</p> 
<p>Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance</p>
<p>Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
